DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.2637718

The cost-effectiveness model for the OPTIMA prelim trial was constructed in R and takes a very similar structural form to many similar models used for the evaluation of technologies for early breast cancer.

This is an adaptation of a previous model:

Any questions or comments please raise as issues.

Please note: the model requires a dataset to run, which is currently not available in the public domain. Please get in touch if you would like to use this.
